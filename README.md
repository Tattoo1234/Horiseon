# Refactor of Horiseon Code
## Description
In this project the goal was to refactor given code so that the HTML reads semantically, so that the CSS is sequential, labeled, and concise, and so that page meets accessability standards.  This was done to optimize search engine placement and to avoid litigation due to lack of accessability.  Problems addressed were replacing generic HTML elements with semantic elements, fixing functionality of navigation keys, adding missing HTML objects, adding alternative image attributes, consolodating CSS elements, and making the code more readable.  In this project I learned new ways to use font color, how to consolodate CSS elements, how to make use of `<Aside>` elements, and how to build navigation keys that link two objects together using `<id Selectors>` within an HTML document; I was also able to review conecepts already covered in BootCamp.
